/*
* we use express middleware (express.static() ), to access static directory here
* "__dirname" used to get absolute path to the project folder(root) from the hard drive
* "__dirname + '/public" used to,
*     >> specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets
*     >> For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a directory named public:
*         >> EX:  http://localhost:3000/images/kitten.jpg
                  http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
                  http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
                  http://localhost:3000/images/bg.png
                  http://localhost:3000/hello.html
* In our case we uses "http://localhost:3000/help.html" which is inside the public static folder
* **Note that weâ€™re going to make everything in the public directory available for viewing. This means that we should not put anything secret/sensitive in there, so keep any files with passwords, tokens, etc. out of the public folder, or users will be able to see it.

/* res.render()
* res.render() - used to render any thing to view, which set as the express view engine. here we have used handlebars(hbs) as our templating for view engine
